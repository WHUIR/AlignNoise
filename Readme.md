This repository contains the official implementation for the paper "Bridging the Gap: Consistent Image Outpainting via Training-Free Noise Optimization", accepted by **ACM Multimedia 2025**.

`AlignNoise` is a novel, training-free, two-stage noise optimization algorithm for image outpainting. It enhances pre-trained diffusion models to generate high-quality, semantically consistent content beyond the original image boundaries, effectively resolving common issues like semantic misalignment and the generation of irregular high-frequency patterns without any fine-tuning.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Training-Free:** Works as a plug-and-play module for any pre-trained diffusion model, avoiding expensive training or fine-tuning.
* **Enhanced Semantic Alignment:** Utilizes a novel attention-based noise optimization strategy to ensure the generated content is semantically consistent with the source image.
* **Artifact Reduction:** Employs a frequency-based noise refinement technique to suppress abnormal patterns and high-frequency artifacts, leading to cleaner results.
* **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieves significant improvements on standard metrics.




## üóìÔ∏è Status

* ‚úÖ Paper accepted by **ACM Multimedia 2025**.
* ‚úÖ Code is made publicly available by **August 2025**.
